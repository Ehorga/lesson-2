                    Hardcore is a variant of Survival and one of the main game modes in Minecraft. In this mode, the world is locked to Hard difficulty and the player cannot respawn after dying.

                <p>The key feature of Hardcore mode is that the player is not given the option to respawn upon death as they would in other game modes. Instead, there are two buttons on the death screen: "Spectate world" and "Title screen". "Spectate world" sets the player to Spectator mode and respawns the player at the world's spawn point, making them able to view and explore the world only in that mode. The "Title screen" button simply leads the player to the main menu screen; re-opening the world simply returns the player back to the same death screen as before. Respawn anchors do not resurrect players in Hardcore mode.</p>

<p>Hardcore mode is an option for multiplayer, and its functions are similar to those in singleplayer. All players have Hardcore mode enabled — it is impossible to have some players in Hardcore and some not. Hardcore mode cannot be played in Realms.</p>
<p>Server operators can use the /gamemode command to change the game mode of themselves or another player.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>When Notch announced Hardcore mode on Twitter, he jokingly posted an image of an 'ultra hardcore' mode where the premium status of the player's account is revoked on death.<sup title="  https://twitter.com/notch/status/117188911230500864"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> This is not to be confused with the custom gamemode of Ultra Hardcore, which was invented later.</li>
                    <li>When a Hardcore mode world is loaded on a version released prior to Hardcore mode, the world is converted into a Survival world. Loading this world in a version featuring Hardcore mode does not revert the world back to Hardcore mode.</li>
                    <li>Hardcore mode doesn’t exist in Minecraft Education.</li>
                    <li>Initially, Hardcore mode was only exclusive to Java Edition, but Jens Bergensten, the lead developer of Minecraft, added Hardcore mode to Bedrock Edition to provide a high-stakes, permadeath challenge experience to players.</li>
